 * @title TokenTimelockPool
 * @author Wibson Development Team <developers@wibson.org>
 * @notice This contract models a pool of tokens to be distributed among beneficiaries,
 * releasing the entire pool on a specific date. There is no need to know the
 * beneficiaries in advance, since the contract allows to add them as time goes by.
 * Note that tokens are NOT revocable.
 * Tokens that were not distributed by the release date will stay in the pool until
 * they are assigned. In which case, the new beneficiary will be able to release
 * them immediately.
 * @dev Total funds and distributed tokens are controlled to avoid refills done
 * by transfering tokens through the ERC20.
